### Networked Learning Communities

Networked Learning Communities (NLCs) are teams of teachers from different schools working and learning collaboratively to examine and reflect on their practice. By engaging in purposeful and sustained developmental activities together, they learn from one another, with one another, and on behalf of others (Jackson & Temperley, 2007). Informed by public knowledge from theory, research, and good practices, teachers in NLCs tap their own knowledge and experience to construct new knowledge together.
