<p>The Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) was set up to spearhead the professional
development of MOE staff. AST together with the other teacher academies
aim to build communities of practice for like-minded professionals of&nbsp;subject
disciplines, for teachers to come together and learn from one another,
developing stronger camaraderie and esprit de corps.</p>

<p>Apart from these dedicated teacher academies and language institutes,
Subject Chapters in AST are set up as networked learning communities for
teacher development and professional sharing for the respective subject
disciplines, focusing on subject mastery and pedagogical content knowledge.</p>
<p>The Academy of Singapore Teachers, subject chapters, teacher academies
and language institutes will work in synergy to foster a stronger teacher-led
culture of professional collaboration and professional excellence, to bring
the teaching fraternity to a higher international standing.</p>
