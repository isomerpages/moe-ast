<h3>Associate Professor Helen Chick (OEIC2025)</h3>
<p>Associate Professor (A/P) Helen Chick is a distinguished academic and
experienced practitioner who holds a PhD in Mathematics from the University
of Tasmania and is a qualified secondary school Mathematics teacher in
Australia. Her excellence in teaching has been recognised through several
awards in Australia, including Teaching Excellence Awards and Teaching
Merit Certificates. A/P Helen's research and classroom practice focus on
pedagogical content knowledge, emphasising effective use of examples, statistics
education, and explicit teaching models in Mathematics. She has extensive
experience providing professional learning programmes for the Department
of Education, Australia, working with both pre-service and in-service teachers
across primary and secondary levels.</p>
<p>Her work on mathematical reasoning and problem-solving aligns closely
with Singapore's Mathematics Problem-Solving Framework, as demonstrated
through her significant contributions in developing "Explicit Teaching"
modules and her Grade 6 teaching videos that translate complex pedagogical
concepts into practical strategies. With her deep understanding of Mathematics
pedagogy, passion for enhancing student learning, and proven track record
in teacher development, A/P Helen is ideally suited to inspire and upskill
Singapore's Mathematics teachers. Her expertise in explicit teaching, problem-solving,
and effective classroom dialogue was invaluable in enhancing our educators'
capabilities.</p>

<h4><strong>Keynote Address at Mathematics Learning Day 1 (22 April)</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive Thinking in the Mathematics Classroom</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This keynote presentation by A/P Helen explored how Critical, Adaptive,
and Inventive Thinking (CAIT) can be fostered in Mathematics education.
The presentation demonstrated that developing CAIT requires deliberate
teacher effort in planning, task selection, classroom culture development,
and questioning. Importantly, fostering CAIT in students also requires
CAIT from teachers themselves. The overarching message was that Mathematics
classrooms can indeed be spaces for creative, critical thinking when teachers
thoughtfully design tasks, cultivate appropriate classroom cultures, and
employ strategic teaching actions.</p>

<h4><strong>Keynote Address at Professional Learning Session 2 for MMs/TLs (29 July)</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Planning for Explicit Learning in Mathematics to Deepen Connections</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This presentation by A/P Helen Chick focused on planning Mathematics lessons
for explicit learning. The session emphasised that planning is critical
as it challenges teachers to identify what explicit learning they want
for their students. Teachers may make different planning decisions, but
what matters are the reasons for their choices. Thinking carefully about
examples, tasks, questions, and connections can significantly impact student
learning, as teaching is fundamentally about ensuring students learn.</p>

<p><u>Overview of Lesson Demonstration at Casuarina Primary School</u>
</p>
<p>A/P Helen collaborated with our local Teacher Collaborator, Mrs Sarah
Teng (Senior Teacher/Mathematics, Casuarina Primary School), to design
and enact a lesson on ‘Fraction as Part of a Whole’ for Primary 2 students.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture6.jpg">
</div>
<p>The lesson systematically built students' understanding of unit fractions
through review, exploration, and application.</p>
<p>Throughout each phase, consistent questioning encouraged students to identify
patterns in notation, naming conventions, and the relationship between
denominators and equal parts, whilst comparing fraction sizes to develop
proportional reasoning.</p>
<p>The lesson concluded with an interactive matching activity where students
identified and grouped fraction cards based on mathematical properties,
effectively consolidating understanding through hands-on manipulatives
and collaborative<strong> </strong>learning.</p>

<p><u>Overview of Lesson Demonstration at Changkat Changi Secondary School</u>
</p>
<p>A/P Helen collaborated with our local Teacher Collaborator, Ms Huang Yaling
(Senior Teacher/Mathematics, Changkat Changi Secondary School), to design
and enact a lesson on ‘Line Graphs’ for Secondary 1 students.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture8.jpg">
</div>
<p>The lesson systematically developed students' understanding of line graphs
through critical analysis of flawed infographics, practical construction
using real-world temperature data of Singapore and Hobart, and comparative
interpretation techniques.</p>
<p>Beginning with examination of a deliberately problematic infographic to
establish graphs as tools for revealing data patterns, students progressed
through structured exploration where they plotted multiple datasets on
shared axes, discovering how visual representation makes patterns more
apparent than tabular data when examining seasonal variation and geographical
differences.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture9.jpg">
</div>
<p>The lesson effectively integrated guided questioning about design choices,
scale selection, and axis labelling, while extending learning through rainfall
analysis and bar graph comparison, demonstrating how hands-on graphing
activities can enhance students' ability to interpret and construct meaningful
statistical representations that facilitate direct data comparison and
trend analysis.</p>
<h4>Overview of Workshops</h4>
<p>A/P Helen conducted four workshops which explored how strategic questioning
transforms Mathematics learning by developing students' CAIT capabilities.
Participants examined six evidence-based question types that enhance classroom
discourse and mathematical reasoning: Reasoning Questions ("How do you
know?") that emphasise justification and reveal student thinking, Hypothetical
Exploration ("What happens if...?") that develops key mathematical ideas
and extends thinking, Example Generation ("Can you give me an example of...?")
that builds students' conceptual understanding through varied examples,
Conditional Reasoning ("Sometimes, always or never true?") that explores
when principles apply and develops logical thinking, Fermi Questions that
develop real-world problem-solving and estimation skills, and Backwards
Questions ("If this is the answer, what might the question have been?")
that emphasise mathematical structure and reversibility.</p>
