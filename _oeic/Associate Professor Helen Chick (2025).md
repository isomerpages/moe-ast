<h4><strong>Keynote Address at Mathematics Learning Day 1 (22 April)</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive Thinking in the Mathematics Classroom</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This keynote presentation by A/P Helen explored how Critical, Adaptive,
and Inventive Thinking (CAIT) can be fostered in Mathematics education.
The presentation demonstrated that developing CAIT requires deliberate
teacher effort in planning, task selection, classroom culture development,
and questioning. Importantly, fostering CAIT in students also requires
CAIT from teachers themselves. The overarching message was that Mathematics
classrooms can indeed be spaces for creative, critical thinking when teachers
thoughtfully design tasks, cultivate appropriate classroom cultures, and
employ strategic teaching actions.</p>

<h4><strong>Keynote Address at Professional Learning Session 2 for MMs/TLs (29 July)</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Planning for Explicit Learning in Mathematics to Deepen Connections</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This presentation by A/P Helen Chick focused on planning Mathematics lessons
for explicit learning. The session emphasised that planning is critical
as it challenges teachers to identify what explicit learning they want
for their students. Teachers may make different planning decisions, but
what matters are the reasons for their choices. Thinking carefully about
examples, tasks, questions, and connections can significantly impact student
learning, as teaching is fundamentally about ensuring students learn.</p>

<h4>Overview of Lesson Demonstration at Casuarina Primary School</h4>
<p>A/P Helen collaborated with our local Teacher Collaborator, Mrs Sarah
Teng (Senior Teacher/Mathematics, Casuarina Primary School), to design
and enact a lesson on ‘Fraction as Part of a Whole’ for Primary 2 students.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture6.jpg">
</div>
<p>The lesson systematically built students' understanding of unit fractions
through review, exploration, and application.</p>
<p>Throughout each phase, consistent questioning encouraged students to identify
patterns in notation, naming conventions, and the relationship between
denominators and equal parts, whilst comparing fraction sizes to develop
proportional reasoning.</p>
<p>The lesson concluded with an interactive matching activity where students
identified and grouped fraction cards based on mathematical properties,
effectively consolidating understanding through hands-on manipulatives
and collaborative<strong> </strong>learning.</p>

<p><u>Overview of Lesson Demonstration at Changkat Changi Secondary School</u>
</p>
<p>A/P Helen collaborated with our local Teacher Collaborator, Ms Huang Yaling
(Senior Teacher/Mathematics, Changkat Changi Secondary School), to design
and enact a lesson on ‘Line Graphs’ for Secondary 1 students.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture8.jpg">
</div>
<p>The lesson systematically developed students' understanding of line graphs
through critical analysis of flawed infographics, practical construction
using real-world temperature data of Singapore and Hobart, and comparative
interpretation techniques.</p>
<p>Beginning with examination of a deliberately problematic infographic to
establish graphs as tools for revealing data patterns, students progressed
through structured exploration where they plotted multiple datasets on
shared axes, discovering how visual representation makes patterns more
apparent than tabular data when examining seasonal variation and geographical
differences.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture9.jpg">
</div>
<p>The lesson effectively integrated guided questioning about design choices,
scale selection, and axis labelling, while extending learning through rainfall
analysis and bar graph comparison, demonstrating how hands-on graphing
activities can enhance students' ability to interpret and construct meaningful
statistical representations that facilitate direct data comparison and
trend analysis.</p>
<h4>Overview of Workshops</h4>
<p>A/P Helen conducted four workshops which explored how strategic questioning
transforms Mathematics learning by developing students' CAIT capabilities.
Participants examined six evidence-based question types that enhance classroom
discourse and mathematical reasoning: Reasoning Questions ("How do you
know?") that emphasise justification and reveal student thinking, Hypothetical
Exploration ("What happens if...?") that develops key mathematical ideas
and extends thinking, Example Generation ("Can you give me an example of...?")
that builds students' conceptual understanding through varied examples,
Conditional Reasoning ("Sometimes, always or never true?") that explores
when principles apply and develops logical thinking, Fermi Questions that
develop real-world problem-solving and estimation skills, and Backwards
Questions ("If this is the answer, what might the question have been?")
that emphasise mathematical structure and reversibility.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Picture10.jpg">
</div>
<p>Through practical implementation strategies and classroom application
examples, teachers gained insights into the power of purposeful questioning
to help students generalise, form Mathematical abstractions, and engage
in deeper mathematical reasoning within active questioning environments.</p>

<p><u>Feedback from Workshop Participants</u>
</p>
<p>Participants found the workshop on questioning techniques to be highly
practical and immediately applicable to their classroom practice. They
particularly valued the structured six question types framework, which
provided ready-to-use templates with clear purposes for developing students'
Critical, Adaptive and Inventive Thinking (CAIT). Using these questions
strategically make students’ thinking visible and help students develop
Mathematical generalisations.</p>
<p>There were strong interests for specific questioning strategies, especially
"What if" questions for deepening conceptual understanding, Fermi questions
for real-world problem-solving, and "Sometimes/always/never true" statements
for promoting Mathematical communication. Teachers also appreciated backwards
questioning techniques and found the "How do you know" prompts effective
for encouraging student reasoning.</p>
<h4>Contextualisation and Application by our Teacher Collaborators</h4>
<p>Our Teacher Collaborators, Mrs Sarah Teng (ST/Mathematics, Casuarina Primary
School) and Ms Huang Yaling (ST/Mathematics, Changkat Changi Secondary
School) both contextualised and applied the questioning techniques they
gleaned from A/P Helen in their own classrooms.</p>
<p>Sarah’s innovative fractions lesson at Casuarina Primary School demonstrated
exemplary use of the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach, where students
explored halves and quarters through hands-on manipulation of square paper
"brownies" before progressing to mathematical notation. Building on familiar
concepts from the "Give me half" story, students discovered that equal
parts can look different while maintaining the same size, developing deep
conceptual understanding through active learning strategies including peer
sharing, class discussions, and visual representations. The lesson effectively
integrated formative assessment through continuous checking for understanding,
thumbs up/down responses, and exit tickets, while employing strategic questioning
techniques to elicit student thinking and build mathematical understanding
through meaningful dialogue, ultimately helping students grasp the concept
that fractions represent equal parts of a whole before introducing abstract
symbols and terminology.</p>

<p>Yaling's statistics lesson at Changkat Changi Secondary School exemplifies
effective blended learning, combining pre-lesson SLS activities on pictograms
and bar graphs with classroom application to pie chart construction using
authentic CCA data. The lesson systematically built understanding through
structured comparison of statistical representations, progressing from
review and analysis to hands-on construction using GeoGebra, while addressing
a common misconception that larger pie chart sectors always indicate a
larger number by comparing different-sized datasets. Employing questioning
techniques inspired by A/P Helen’s workshop on fostering Critical, Adaptive
and Inventive Thinking, Yaling used strategic prompts like "Which statistical
diagram is easier to draw?" and "Is it sometimes, always or never true
that...?" to develop students' critical thinking about data interpretation.
The lesson integrated continuous formative assessment through Classkick
uploads, real-time feedback, and confidence scale self-assessment, demonstrating
how technology tools can enhance mathematical understanding while encouraging
students to justify their reasoning rather than simply providing correct
answers.</p>

<h4>OEIC Insights from Professional Conversation(s) with NIE, CPDD, and AST</h4>
<p>A/P Helen found the professional dialogues to be valuable and mutually
beneficial. These conversations enabled all participants to compare education
systems, discuss current priorities for Mathematics learning and teaching
in a rapidly changing world. She expressed appreciation for meeting educators
who demonstrate strong commitment to making a difference for the teachers
they work with and, ultimately, for students.</p>
<h4>OEIC Insights for Mathematics Education</h4>
<p>A/P Helen's educational philosophy is deeply rooted in her multifaceted
background as a mathematician and mathematics educator. Her approach is
founded on a deep belief that everyone has a right to access the power
and beauty of mathematics, viewing her role as facilitating students' pathways
to familiarity and fluency with key Mathematical concepts. She advocates
for a balanced approach where students develop core skills applicable in
routine contexts while engaging in genuine problem-solving, emphasising
that Mathematics fundamentally involves generalising from specific cases.
Central to her philosophy is the belief that students should understand
Mathematics conceptually, not merely perform tasks procedurally, requiring
both relational and instrumental understanding through carefully designed
classroom activities, discussions, and questioning strategies.</p>
<p>A/P Helen acknowledges that teachers may hold different views of Mathematics
and student learning but believes that appropriate professional learning
can enhance teachers' repertoires by demonstrating new practices, developing
new skills, and generating productive reflection. She recognises the practical
challenges in ensuring professional learning programmes<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> </a>reach as many teachers as possible
to enhance teaching practices that help students see Mathematics as meaningful,
useful, and beautiful while building strong conceptual connections.</p>
<p>We are honoured to have collaborated with A/P Helen through the OEIC Programme
and we would like to thank her for her generosity in sharing her insights
with our local educators.</p>
