<h3>Associate Professor Helen Chick (OEIC2025)</h3>
<p>Associate Professor (A/P) Helen Chick is a distinguished academic and
experienced practitioner who holds a PhD in Mathematics from the University
of Tasmania and is a qualified secondary school Mathematics teacher in
Australia. Her excellence in teaching has been recognised through several
awards in Australia, including Teaching Excellence Awards and Teaching
Merit Certificates. A/P Helen's research and classroom practice focus on
pedagogical content knowledge, emphasising effective use of examples, statistics
education, and explicit teaching models in Mathematics. She has extensive
experience providing professional learning programmes for the Department
of Education, Australia, working with both pre-service and in-service teachers
across primary and secondary levels.</p>
<p>Her work on mathematical reasoning and problem-solving aligns closely
with Singapore's Mathematics Problem-Solving Framework, as demonstrated
through her significant contributions in developing "Explicit Teaching"
modules and her Grade 6 teaching videos that translate complex pedagogical
concepts into practical strategies. With her deep understanding of Mathematics
pedagogy, passion for enhancing student learning, and proven track record
in teacher development, A/P Helen is ideally suited to inspire and upskill
Singapore's Mathematics teachers. Her expertise in explicit teaching, problem-solving,
and effective classroom dialogue was invaluable in enhancing our educators'
capabilities.</p>

<h4><strong>Keynote Address at Mathematics Learning Day 1 (22 April)</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Critical, Adaptive, and Inventive Thinking in the Mathematics Classroom</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This keynote presentation by A/P Helen explored how Critical, Adaptive,
and Inventive Thinking (CAIT) can be fostered in Mathematics education.
The presentation demonstrated that developing CAIT requires deliberate
teacher effort in planning, task selection, classroom culture development,
and questioning. Importantly, fostering CAIT in students also requires
CAIT from teachers themselves. The overarching message was that Mathematics
classrooms can indeed be spaces for creative, critical thinking when teachers
thoughtfully design tasks, cultivate appropriate classroom cultures, and
employ strategic teaching actions.</p>

<h4><strong>Keynote Address at Professional Learning Session 2 for MMs/TLs (29 July)</strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>Planning for Explicit Learning in Mathematics to Deepen Connections</em></strong>
</p>
<p>This presentation by A/P Helen Chick focused on planning Mathematics lessons
for explicit learning. The session emphasised that planning is critical
as it challenges teachers to identify what explicit learning they want
for their students. Teachers may make different planning decisions, but
what matters are the reasons for their choices. Thinking carefully about
examples, tasks, questions, and connections can significantly impact student
learning, as teaching is fundamentally about ensuring students learn.</p>
