<p>The lesson focused on place-based learning, exploring the Serangoon Reservoir
Catchment at Hougang Town to understand water management in the local environment.
Using a variety of EdTech tools, students engaged in a variety of resources
such as paintings, photographs, videos and narratives of local residents
and found out why the importance of their local river in the past and present.</p>
<p>To get them to be concerned about water conservation, students were also
challenged to consider how our four national taps may be affected by future
scenarios such as climate change. The lesson ended with students reflecting
on ways in which we can play a part in conserving water from the individual
to city scale.</p>
<p>Through this interdisciplinary learning experience, students gained insights

<h4><strong><u>Overview of Onsite Workshops</u></strong></h4>
<p>Emma modelled pedagogical leadership by providing perspectives on place-based
education to enhance learning experiences for students through her perspectives
as a Geography educator, academic, and work in the public transportation
and urban planning sector. She encouraged teachers to consider connections
between the self and community through various activities such as mental
maps which drew from individuals’ personal geographies, values analyses,
and debates based on authentic case studies from the community, to invite
students to reflect more deeply on their relationship with their local
context and environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The workshops were customised to meet the learning needs of various teachers’
levels and profiles (i.e. Secondary, JC Teachers, Middle Managers, Teacher
Leaders). The learning activities encourage collaborative learning and
sharing of classroom practices and experiences, which allows teachers to
exchange best practices and address common concerns. This tailored approach
facilitated targeted exploration of pedagogical strategies, assessment
methods, and pedagogical leadership development, fostering impactful learning
experiences across different teaching profiles and levels.</p>

<p>Emma's presentation on "Place-based education in a rapidly changing world"
highlighted the importance of place in geography education and outlined
key principles for implementing place-based pedagogies. Emma demonstrated
infusing place-based learning into lessons through the lens of 'Big Concepts,
Community Contexts’. Her emphasis on student agency through the "Ask, Find
Out, Act" frame and the inclusion of community perspectives underscored
the transformative power of place-based education. These practical strategies
empowered teachers to deepen students' understanding of geographical concepts,
foster environmental and societal responsibility, and empower them to become
informed, responsible stewards of the Earth.</p>

<h4>Contextualisation and Application of Place-based education by our Teacher Collaborators</h4>
<p>Our Teacher Collaborators, Mr Alvin Yeo (LT/Geography, Holy Innocents’
High School) and Ms Suriani Amran (ST/Geography, Catholic Junior College)
contextualised and applied place-based learning in their classroom context
by incorporating real-world, local examples to enrich students' understanding
of key concepts.</p>
<p>Alvin centred his lesson on the importance of a good transport system
in a city, using Singapore's public transport development and Hougang as
a case study. By engaging students in activities that involve analysing
historical and current maps, examining changes in transport infrastructure,
and reflecting on the economic, social, and environmental significance
of transport evolution, the lesson prompts students to consider the impact
of good transport on their lives and the city.</p>
