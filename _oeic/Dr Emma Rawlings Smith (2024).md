<h3><strong>Dr Emma Rawlings Smith (2024)</strong></h3>
<h4><strong><u>AST’s 32nd Outstanding Educator-in-Consultancy (OEIC) Programme</u></strong></h4>
<p>Dr Emma Rawlings Smith is a distinguished figure in Sustainability and
Geography Education. Currently serving as a Lecturer in Sustainability
and Geography Education at the University of Southampton, Emma is a Chartered
Geographer and trustee of the Royal Geographical Society, actively contributing
to advancing education and geography programs. She brings a wealth of experience
from her background as a Secondary and Pre-university Geography and Environmental
Science teacher in schools in England and the United Arab Emirates. Emma
serves as the Sustainability Champion of the Southampton Education School,
with research areas in teacher education, curriculum design, and place-based
education.</p>
<p>Emma believes effective teaching and learning requires a coherent and
progressive school curriculum. This curriculum is conceptually underpinned,
relevant to the local context, and designed to equip students with knowledge
and skills for navigating an ever-changing world. It includes embedding
technology use meaningfully and incorporating interdisciplinary ideas in
the classroom. Collaborative approaches could also be adopted to foster
critical thinking and deep learning among students and effective professional
learning is crucial in realising these educational goals.</p>

<p>Prior to her engagement as the Outstanding Educator for AST’s OEIC 2024
(from 15 April to 26 April 2024), Emma collaborated closely with our Master
Teacher/Geography, Ms Melanie Lum, in co-designing and co-developing engagements
for our educators. These in-depth discussions explored the opportunities
and affordances for incorporating place-based learning and sustainability
education in the local context, and further deepening the beliefs and pedagogical
practices of Geography educators with an eye on the evolving education
landscape and development of students' Emerging 21st Century Competencies
(E21CC). The outcomes of this collaboration has enriched the professional
learning of local Geography educators and laid the groundwork for impactful
and contextually relevant learning experiences for students.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Overview of Lesson Demonstration at Holy Innocents’ High School</u></strong></h4>
<p>Emma collaborated with our local Teacher Collaborator, Mr Alvin Yeo (Lead
Teacher/Geography, Holy Innocents’ High School (HIHS)), to apply place-based
learning strategies for teaching the concept of sustainable water management
in a Secondary One classroom at Holy Innocents’ High School (HIHS).</p>

<p>The lesson focused on place-based learning, exploring the Serangoon Reservoir
Catchment at Hougang Town to understand water management in the local environment.</p>
<p>The lesson focused on place-based learning, exploring the Serangoon Reservoir
Catchment at Hougang Town to understand water management in the local environment.
Using a variety of EdTech tools, students engaged in a variety of resources
such as paintings, photographs, videos and narratives of local residents
and found out why the importance of their local river in the past and present.</p>
<p>To get them to be concerned about water conservation, students were also
challenged to consider how our four national taps may be affected by future
scenarios such as climate change. The lesson ended with students reflecting
on ways in which we can play a part in conserving water from the individual
to city scale.</p>
<p>Through this interdisciplinary learning experience, students gained insights
into the interconnectedness of human activities and natural systems, fostering
a sense of responsibility towards environmental conservation.</p>

<h4><strong><u>Overview of Onsite Workshops</u></strong></h4>
<p>Emma modelled pedagogical leadership by providing perspectives on place-based
education to enhance learning experiences for students through her perspectives
as a Geography educator, academic, and work in the public transportation
and urban planning sector. She encouraged teachers to consider connections
between the self and community through various activities such as mental
maps which drew from individuals’ personal geographies, values analyses,
and debates based on authentic case studies from the community, to invite
students to reflect more deeply on their relationship with their local
context and environment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The workshops were customised to meet the learning needs of various teachers’
levels and profiles (i.e. Secondary, JC Teachers, Middle Managers, Teacher
Leaders). The learning activities encourage collaborative learning and
sharing of classroom practices and experiences, which allows teachers to
exchange best practices and address common concerns. This tailored approach
facilitated targeted exploration of pedagogical strategies, assessment
methods, and pedagogical leadership development, fostering impactful learning
experiences across different teaching profiles and levels.</p>

and innovative ideas for executing sustainability lessons, and they highlighted
the importance of integrating place-based learning in everyday lessons;
planning for intentional experiences; and applying place-based learning
in the classroom with greater depth. They also expressed interest in exploring
different inquiry methods to enhance students’ learning experiences.</p>
<h4><strong><u>Overview of Webinar and OE sharing</u></strong></h4>
<p>The webinar, titled "Applying Place-based Learning in Sustainability Education
– What does it look, sound and feel like?" focused on the integration of
place-based learning into sustainability education, aiming to empower students
with civic, global, and cross-cultural literacy within the framework of
Emerging 21st Century Competencies (E21CC).</p>
