During her attachment, Mrs Janeth Morata-Fuentes conducted Master Classes for Chemistry teachers where they learned about the principles of green chemistry, and how these principles could be applied in their Chemistry classrooms. Participants of the Master Classes also had the opportunity to design Chemistry lessons that integrated these principles.

Mrs Janeth Morata-Fuentes had the opportunity to visit School of Science and Technology and Ngee Ann Secondary School. During her visit to School of Science and Technology, Mrs Janeth Morata-Fuentes observed classroom lessons by teachers who incorporated the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT) into their inquiry-based lessons. She was given a tour of the campus and engaged in a conversation with the staff members of the Science Department on the teaching and learning of Science.

At Ngee Ann Secondary School, she toured the school and had a dialogue with the school leaders and key personnel on the school’s integration of ICT into the curriculum.

Mrs Janeth Morata-Fuentes engaged in two professional dialogues: with colleagues from Curriculum Planning and Development Division (CPDD), Educational Technology Division (ETD) and Gifted Education Branch (GEB); and with National Institute of Education (NIE). During the dialogue with CPDD, ETD and GEB, insights and ideas on curriculum planning and design were exchanged. The session with NIE saw a lively discussion on the structure of pre-service teacher education and teacher preparation programmes in the Philippines and in Singapore.

During her OEIR stint, Mrs Janeth Morata-Fuentes had a positive impact on all whom she interacted with, inspiring many teachers to consider how they could reduce or eliminate the use, or generation, of hazardous substances in their Chemistry classrooms.
