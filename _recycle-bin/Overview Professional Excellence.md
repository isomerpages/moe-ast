### Professional Excellence

A culture of professional excellence is characterised by:   
  

#### Strong Teacher Leadership and Teacher Ownership

We call on teacher leaders to step forward to lead the teaching fraternity.  Besides taking greater pride in and ownership of their core mission of developing the whole child, teacher leaders will rally their peers and inspire them to take on greater ownership of their professional growth and development.

  

#### Collaborative Professionalism and System-wide Mentoring

A culture of collaboration is fostered when teachers share with and learn from one another.  The formation of professional learning communities and other professional networks support the sharing of good practices.  This ensures consistency of high quality in teaching and learning across our system.

  

#### Continuous Learning and Improvement

Promoting a culture of continuous learning and improvement will lead to a higher level of professional competence. As life-long learners, we encourage all teachers to continue to hone their professional practice as they aspire to become stronger teachers.
