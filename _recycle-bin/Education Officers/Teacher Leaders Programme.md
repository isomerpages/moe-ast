### Teacher Leaders Programme
 

The Teacher Leaders Programme (TLP) is a suite of three milestone programmes that are designed by the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST), in collaboration with the National Institute of Education (NIE). Each TLP aims to support the growth of officially appointed Teacher Leaders, and helps them work towards achieving the key result areas aligned to their specific roles.

The learning experiences in these milestone programmes shape the professional disposition of the Teacher Leaders and strengthen the skills and knowledge towards the fulfilment of the five desired teacher outcomes of the Teacher Growth Model (TGM):

*   The Ethical Educator
*   The Competent Professional
*   The Collaborative Learner
*   The Transformational Leader
*   The Community Builder

This programme seeks to prepare Teacher Leaders for their roles as pedagogical leaders and instructional mentors to others. Each programme focuses on creating a variety of purposeful learning experiences that inspire new ways of teaching and learning.  These experiences are built upon the firm foundation of holistic education and core beliefs as reflected in the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP).

The modules in the milestone programmes reflect the expected scope of impact and influence of Teacher Leaders.  Close referencing is made to the ethos of the teaching profession and participants’ roles as pedagogical leaders and instructional mentors in the fraternity.
