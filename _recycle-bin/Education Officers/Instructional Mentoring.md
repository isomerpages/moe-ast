#### Instructional Mentoring Programme

The Instructional Mentoring Programme equips mentors with an understanding of mentees’ needs and the tools that support effective mentoring.  By the end of the six-modules programme, mentors would also be able to integrate the Singapore Teaching Practice into their mentoring conversations.

The Instructional Mentoring Programme is recommended for Senior Teachers, Lead Teachers and School Staff Developers who are keen to grow their fellow teachers through mentoring and build a professional development that nurtures trusting and developmental mentoring relationships.

_This programme is open to mentors nominated by schools. Participants who have successfully completed the Instructional Mentoring Programme_ _will be identified as ‘Instructional Mentors’ in their Curriculum Vitae in the Human Resource Management System (HRMS)._
