### Outstanding Educator-in-Consultancy (OEIC) Programme

In his Opening Address at the 5th Teachers’ Conference 2010, Dr Ng Eng Hen, the former Minister for Education and Second Minister for Defence, highlighted the reputation which Singapore’s education system enjoys in the international arena. This reputation could augment the building of a culture of continuous learning and improvement in Singapore’s teaching profession. With this in mind, the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) designed the Outstanding Educator-in-Residence (OEIR) Programme.

The OEIR programme was later revamped into the Outstanding Educator-in-Consultancy (OEIC) programme, taking into consideration of the approaches for blended learning and sustainability of professional development. The OEIC programme provides opportunities for the overseas outstanding educators (OEs) to share their innovative subject-specific pedagogies/strategies with our local educators. Together with a Master Teacher from AST and a local teacher, the innovative pedagogies/strategies shared by an OE will be enacted in the Singapore classroom context. These innovative pedagogical practices will then be shared with the Singapore teachers through the workshops on physical and/or online platforms.

The OEIC programme aims to

1\.  leverage the expertise of outstanding overseas educators to enhance the integration of knowledge into practice, <br>
2.  increase the capacity of educators (local and foreign) to work collaboratively towards quality education programmes and innovative curriculum design,<br>
3.  enrich the application of knowledge by providing opportunities for classroom research, practice, and consultation, as opposed to pure academic research and discussions; and <Br>
4.  forge sustained partnerships with international educators and better understanding and appreciation of our education system, through the agency of the Academy of Singapore Teachers.

#### Networking Opportunities with Outstanding Overseas Educators
 

Local educators may be interested to conduct learning journeys to the native countries of the OEs or learn more about their education systems.  To facilitate professional networked learning between the Singapore teachers and the OEs, AST has created a database of information and resources for ease of collaboration. We believe that through this connectivity, both the local and international educators can continue to explore future educational opportunities in the spirit of continuous learning and improvement.
