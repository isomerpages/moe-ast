#### Profile

Hadzar has been a Learning Support Coordinator (LSC) since 2005 and an LSC mentor since 2008. Prior to joining AST in 2022, Hadzar was a Lead Teacher / Educational Support for about 5 years. Her work revolved mainly around building the professional development of teachers in her school, cluster and zone, in the area of motivation and engagement of students. She believes strongly that teachers play an important role in building a positive classroom culture to motivate and engage students. She led networked learning communities (NLCs) amongst teacher leaders in the cluster, zone and at national level. Some of the learning in the NLCs include Positive Teacher Language, Growth Mindset, Self-Determination Theory and Brain-based Learning to bring about positive change in classrooms.  

To empower herself to advise teachers on how to support low progress learners and students with Special Educational Needs (SEN), Hadzar pursued further education in SEN, Autism and Dyslexia. With first-hand experience working with families from low SES background, Hadzar’s perspectives on SEN and low progress learners was integral in providing an empathetic and practical approach in supporting these students.
