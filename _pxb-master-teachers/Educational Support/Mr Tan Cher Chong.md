#### Profile

Cher Chong completed his Master of Education (Developmental Psychology) at the National Institute of Education in 2011, and was appointed Master Teacher/ Educational Support in 2016. Prior to joining the Academy of Singapore Teachers, Cher Chong was a Head of Department at Spectra Secondary School and before that, NorthLight School. His work mainly revolved around pastoral care and student development. As Master Teacher/ Educational Support, Cher Chong supports teachers who are working with struggling students to connect them back to a safe and supportive school community, as well as provide the appropriate intervention to build up their internal assets and external resources so that they can overcome their challenges and return to healthy development. He also works with various networked learning communities to raise the professional competencies of teachers, and promote teacher-leadership among them.  
  
Cher Chong is a volunteer tutor at the Tanah Merah Prison. The inmates have taught him that education is always kinder, cheaper and more lasting than rehabilitation.  
  
He also serves as a panel member on the Films Consultative Panel @ iMDA, providing views on films to assist iMDA in making classification decisions. As the panel comprises representatives from various strata and sectors of the society, the opinions he gathers at panel discussions help him bring back to work valuable perspectives that may impact school programmes and student learning.  
  
Last but not least, Cher Chong is a member of the Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) for Big Love Child Protection Specialist Centre. The MDT serves as a committee for consultation of moderate risk child abuse and neglect cases. It comprises social workers and representatives from other professions including paediatricians, legal advisors, psychiatrists and educators. His involvement in MDT helps Cher Chong to learn about the approach and management of such cases, and how he can better support students and families in need.
