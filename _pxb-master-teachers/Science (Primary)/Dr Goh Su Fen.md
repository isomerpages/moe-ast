#### Profile

Su Fen began her teaching career in a primary school after graduating from the National University of Singapore with a BSc in Microbiology. Her passion in the teaching and learning of Science led her to continue to pursue an MSc in Education and a PhD where she delved into the learning environment of primary science classrooms. Prior to her appointment as a Master Teacher in 2016, Su Fen served as the Head of Department (Science) in a primary school. She was also seconded as a Teaching Fellow to the National Institute of Education where she was involved in teacher education and as a Senior Curriculum Planning Officer at MOE (CPDD), both secondments specialising in the area of science education.

As a Master Teacher, she strives to engage in continual professional growth and leverage her knowledge and experiences learned through her own career growth in science education, curriculum development, and teacher education to promote primary science education more effectively through meaningful collaboration with fellow teachers. She believes in and endeavours to continue her efforts in impacting teachers to raise the level of science education through creating powerful and stimulating experiences for students in the learning of science.
