#### Profile

Ms Anna Koh graduated from the National University of Singapore with a Bachelor of Science (Hons) in Zoology. Upon graduation, she went to the National Institute of Education where she obtained her Post-Graduate Diploma in Education (Secondary), after which she was posted to Jurong Secondary School where she started her teaching career. She completed her Management and Leadership in Schools Programme (MLS) in 2010 and was certified in Special Needs Support (TSN) in 2012.  
  
Prior to her accreditation as Master Teacher in 2017, Ms Koh taught in the same school for 19 years, taking on several portfolios and job scopes at different points of time. This allowed her to work with various profiles of students and teachers. As a Biology Teacher, she had been involved in creating learning spaces within the school such as building ecological ponds and gardens for authentic and engaged learning. She has also led professional learning teams in the design, implementation and review of TLLM Biology curriculum within her school – this included a lower secondary problem-based learning curriculum to stretch the higher-ability learners as well as an integrated multi-disciplinary lower secondary normal (technical) curriculum to engage the lower-ability learners. In her last appointment as a School Staff Developer, she worked closely with the Senior Teachers to build the competency of Beginning Teachers and pre-service teachers in the craft of Teaching and Learning.
