#### Profile

Meng Leng began his career teaching Biology in a junior college after graduating from the National University of Singapore with a B.Sc (Hons) in Life Sciences. His interest in adult learning led him to pursue a Masters of Arts in Professional Education from the Nanyang Technological University. He also headed an ICT department in a secondary school, where he supported the teachers in deepening their pedagogical practices with technology. Apart from serving in schools, Meng Leng held a stint with the Educational Technology Division where he led interest-based learning communities, taught technology-based professional learning programmes and consulted for schools. Prior to joining AST, he was seconded to the National Institute of Education as a Teaching Fellow where he was involved in teacher preparation programmes, teacher leader and in-service courses. In recognition of his contribution to the professional development of teachers in the fraternity, he was conferred the Fellow of the Academy of Singapore Teachers in 2015.

Meng Leng believes in working closely with teachers to co-construct knowledge and being their critical friend, allowing them to view their professional development experience in a positive light. He hopes to use his diverse experiences to contribute to professional development through mentoring teacher leaders, supporting professional networks and engaging in pedagogical research.
