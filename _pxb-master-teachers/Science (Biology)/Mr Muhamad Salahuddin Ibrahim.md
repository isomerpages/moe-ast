#### Profile

_Salahuddin taught Biology in Serangoon Junior College for the first 20 years of his teaching career before coming to AST as a Master Teacher in 2019. He was HOD Student Welfare in SRJC before eventually joining the teaching track to serve as a Senior and then a Lead Teacher. He believes in the value of strong relationships both with students and amongst teachers. To him, the value of positive collaborative relationships between teachers can never be underestimated. He also advocates the power of getting students to step out of their comfort zone and to think critically both in the classroom and beyond._

_Salahuddin was awarded the ‘Fellow of AST’ in 2014, the ‘President’s Award for Teachers’ in 2015._  
  
In his personal life, Salahuddin values quality time with his family. He enjoys travelling as a means to deepen familial bonds and as a way to recharge his spirit. An avid reader, he also enjoys playing sports such as soccer and badminton and is a longtime fan of Liverpool FC so he never walks alone.
