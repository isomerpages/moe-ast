#### Profile

Mr Ng Song Beng has been a Lead Teacher/Mathematics at Northbrooks Secondary School for four years prior to his appointment as Master Teacher/Secondary Mathematics at the Academy of Singapore in 2022.  He has also held various leadership appointments such as Head of Department, School Staff Developer and Vice-Principal.  His teaching experiences range from Secondary One to Secondary Four Mathematics and Additional Mathematics in various streams.

Song Beng graduated from the National University of Singapore with Mathematics major in 1989 under a Singapore Government Scholarship.  He obtained a Post Graduate Diploma in Education with Merit from the National Institute of Education, National Technological University, Singapore in 1991.  As a lifelong learner, when the first wave of Internet hit Singapore, he enrolled and graduated with a Master in Information Studies from the National Technological University, Singapore in 2000 to reskill himself in the Digital Age. 

He deliberately seeks out classroom teaching experiences with students of diverse profiles to better understand how different pedagogies could better engage these students.  He believes strongly in doing his best for his students.  Song Beng is interested in how growth mindset theories could scaffold the learning of students with low self-motivation.  He is also interested in how these theories could help instil a life-long learning mindset in our teachers.  He regularly shared in different platforms to learn with the fraternity with a mission to impact the Mathematics teachers in Singapore.  He was conferred the Associate of Academy of Singapore Teachers in 2012, 2020 and 2021.  In recognition of his effort, he was conferred the National Day Commendation Medal in 2021.
