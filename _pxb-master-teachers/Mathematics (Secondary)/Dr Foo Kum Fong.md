#### Profile

Mdm Foo Kum Fong has been a teacher for 30 years. Since 2007, she has served as Master Teacher in Mathematics in the East Zone. In this capacity, Mdm Foo provides leadership in the teaching and learning of Mathematics across schools in the zone.

She also served as editor of Maths Buzz, a publication of the Association of Mathematics Educators since Oct 2003 to May 2009. Between 2003 and 2006, Mdm Foo took a secondment at the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University (NIE) as a teaching fellow in the Pre-Service Teacher Training programme. Within the zone, Mdm Foo has initiated closer working relationships between the East Zone’s Centre for Excellence in Mathematics, the Maths Department of the National University of Singapore and various divisions within the Ministry of Education. In this way she leveraged her experience as a Curriculum Planning Officer at MOE (2000-2002) and her years teaching at NIE to build strong network learning communities amongst teachers from different schools.

Mdm Foo has a number of published journal articles and has participated in international Mathematics Conferences. In 2008, she gave a lesson demonstration at Huamao Foreign Language School (Secondary) upon the invitation of Ningbo University, People’s Republic of China. In 2009, she presented at the Zhengzhou Roundtable a request by the Zhengzhou City Education Bureau, a lesson using the Teaching for Understanding Framework by Harvard Graduate School of Education. As a recipient of the Fulbright Distinguished Award in Teaching in 2009, Mdm Foo leveraged her learning experience in the Peabody College, University of Vanderbilt from Aug to Dec 2009 to guide her study on how open-ended tasks can engage students in constructive thinking in the context of mathematical problem solving. She is currently pursuing her Doctorate in Education with NIE under the MOE Post Graduate Scholarship.
