#### Profile

Prior to his appointment as Master Teacher, Liang Soon possessed a wealth of experience in teaching and leading Mathematics learning in Singapore with students across different age groups, including 15 to 16 year olds at Raffles Institution, and 17 to 18 year olds at Jurong Junior College, where he also held the position of Head of Department for Mathematics. As Teaching Fellow at the Mathematics and Mathematics Education Academic Group in the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, he taught pre-service teachers enrolled in the Bachelor of Science (Education) for undergraduates with pre-university qualifications, and the Postgraduate Diploma in Education programme for university graduates. Liang Soon conducted many workshops at the cluster, zonal and national level for mathematics teachers in mathematical modelling and constructivist learning experiences. For his contributions to the professional development of teachers in the fraternity, Liang Soon was conferred the Associate of Academy of Singapore Teachers in 2016.

As a Master Teacher, Liang Soon strives to lead, mentor and inspire secondary and JC mathematics teachers to be caring, competent and passionate educators who live out the ethos of the profession and provide quality education experience for students. He believes that mathematical problem solving should be the salient feature of the complete mathematics learning experiences for all students. As a fraternity, he aims to shape and build the identity of the mathematics teachers so that they would come forth to transform their practice in enriching and deepening students’ learning.  

Liang Soon holds a Master of Information Technology in Education from University of Melbourne, Australia, and a Master of Science in Mathematics as well as a Doctorate in Mathematics Education from the National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. He is interested in mathematical modelling, cognitive psychology and professional learning of teachers, and regularly engages in professional development and research projects involving mathematical applications and modelling.
