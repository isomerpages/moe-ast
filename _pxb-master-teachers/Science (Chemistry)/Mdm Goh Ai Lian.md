#### Profile

Ai Lian has served for 25 years in the education service and has the experience of teaching Chemistry in a junior college and in a secondary school. She has served in different portfolios, such as HOD and Vice-Principal. Prior to joining AST, she has been a Lead Teacher in Damai Secondary School for 6 years.

 Ai Lian firmly believes that teaching is both an art and a science where teachers play a critical role in igniting the curiosity and joy of learning in their learners. Adopting the “teacher as learner” mindset, she has explored areas such as inquiry-based learning, concept-based teaching and using questions and feedback in her classrooms. She is keen to learn more about using assessment data and applying strategies based on neuroscientific findings to enhance teaching practices. She strongly believes that there is value in teachers growing teachers and looks forward to working closely with fellow educators to enhance the teaching and learning of Chemistry and to foster a community of reflective and collaborative practitioners.
