#### Profile

Shahrin graduated from the National University of Singapore with a B.Sc (2nd Upper Hons) in Biochemistry in 1988 and obtained a Masters of Education in 2000. In 2015, he obtained a Doctor of Education from Durham University (United Kingdom).  His thesis entitled “An Exploratory Study of Pre-Service Primary Teachers’ Understanding of Uncertainty in Measurements in Singapore” demonstrates his keen interest in teachers’ professional development and the Nature of Science. He also obtained a Diploma in Education from IE (Singapore) in 1989 and a Diploma in Departmental Management from NIE, Nanyang Technological University in 2003.  
Shahrin’s vast teaching experience comes from having served in different capacities: a HOD Science in a Secondary and an Independent school, a HOD Curriculum & Pedagogy in his last school, and as a Teaching Fellow at the NIE for 4 years teaching a range of pre-service and in-service courses at both primary and secondary levels.  
Shahrin is a firm advocate of life-long learning, and believes in building teachers’ professional capacity through mentoring as well as collaborative and professional networking.
