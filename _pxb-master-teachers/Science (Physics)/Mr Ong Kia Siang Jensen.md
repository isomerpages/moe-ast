#### Profile

Jensen graduated from the National University of Singapore with a B.Sc (Hons) in Physics. He completed the Post Graduate Diploma in Education (PGDE) programme at National Institute of Education, NTU. He continued to pursue a Master of Education in Curriculum and Instruction at Boston College, USA in 2012.

Jensen started his education career as a Physics teacher at National Junior College where he was also the pioneer batch of science teachers in the integrated programme department. He then moved on to head the science department at Commonwealth secondary school. Apart from serving in schools, Jensen held short stint at MOE (CPDD) as a Curriculum Planning Officer specialising in the A level physics curriculum. He was also seconded to National Institute of Education as a Teaching Fellow where he was involved in teacher preparation programmes for physics teachers. He was appointed Master Teacher/Physics in 2021.

With a paradigm shift in professional development when the latter is no longer restricted to teachers attending structured courses but teachers taking ownership in charting their own learning and development. Jensen see himself as a catalyst in creating a healthy culture of learning, sharing and networking within the fraternity, where teachers could come together, and seeing each other as a community of practice. He hopes to use his diverse experiences over the years to contribute to professional development more effectively through mentoring teacher leaders, leading professional networks, and working alongside teachers in pedagogical research in the classrooms.Â
