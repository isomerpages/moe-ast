<p>
The NFS Chapter works closely with Curriculum Planning and Development Division and other related educational agencies to extend learning in Nutrition and Food Science. &nbsp;Through collaboration and networking, it harnesses synergy among Nutrition and Food Science teachers in schools, MOE Divisions and institutions of higher education to work towards improved student outcomes.<br><br>

Through collaborative learning in&nbsp;the NFS professional&nbsp;network,&nbsp;teachers&nbsp;could broaden&nbsp;their professional knowledge and improve their practices. There will be opportunities to obtain updates on curriculum and pedagogy, and to&nbsp;share ideas and resources with fellow teachers in the NFS&nbsp;fraternity.<br><br>

<b>We organise various professional learning activities for you:</b> <br><br>

•   Courses and learning programmes<br>
•   Learning journeys<br>
•   Professional conversations with overseas and local educators<br>
•   Networked learning sessions e.g. ST-LT network<br>
•   Professional learning sessions for BTs
