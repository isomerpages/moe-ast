<p>
The Biology Chapter is a platform to encourage&nbsp;pedagogical innovation and research-informed practice to impact teaching.&nbsp;It works closely with Curriculum Planning&nbsp;and Development Division&nbsp;and other related educational agencies to extend learning in Biology.&nbsp; Through collaboration and networking, it harnesses synergy among teachers in schools, MOE Divisions and professional associations. <br><br>
	
The key objective of Biology Chapter is to&nbsp;enhance the capacity and capability of teachers in the learning and teaching of Biology. <br><br>
	
The Master Teachers lead in facilitating professional development through courses and networks, such as:<br><br>
	
•   Differentiated Instruction<br>
•   Inquiry-based Learning<br>
•   Assessment Literacy<br>
•   Concept-based Learning and Assessment<br>
•   Performance Based Assessments<br>
•   Literacy in Biology<br>
•   Learning Journeys<br>
•   Professional learning sessions for BTs<br>
•   Networked learning sessions e.g. ST-LT network<br><br>
	
We organise various professional learning events for you:<br><br>

•   Learning Day<br>
•   AST/CPDD Community Day<br>
•   Masterclasses<br>
•   Professional conversations with overseas and local educators<br>

Through collaborative learning in a network, a teacher could broaden his/her professional knowledge and improve his/her practice. The workshops run by Master Teachers adopt a 5C approach whereby participants are guided in translating what they learn at the workshops into classroom practice.
