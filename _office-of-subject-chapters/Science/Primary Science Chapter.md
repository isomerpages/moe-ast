<div>  
  
<p>
The key objective of the Primary Science Chapter is to deepen primary science teachers’ pedagogical content knowledge for quality student learning, and to build a culture of teacher-led professionalism and pride among primary science teachers.&nbsp; It serves as a focal point for professional collaboration and networked learning among primary science teachers.” <br><br>

<img src="/images/psc3.png" style="width:70%"> <br><br>
	
The Primary Science Chapter equips Primary Science teachers with impactful and innovative pedagogies that are underpinned by sound learning theories, experimentation and research.&nbsp; It is a professional network to raise professional standards in science disciplines in&nbsp;general and primary in particular.<br><br>

The Primary Science Chapter encourages pedagogical innovation and facilitates research-informed practice to impact teaching. It works closely with Curriculum Planning&nbsp;and Development Division&nbsp;and other related educational agencies to extend learning in Primary Science.&nbsp; Through collaboration and networking, it harnesses synergy among teachers in schools, MOE Divisions and professional associations. In time, it will extend its networks and partnerships with international education agencies.<br><br>

Through collaborative learning in a network, a teacher could broaden&nbsp;their professional knowledge and improve their practice. The workshops run by Master Teachers adopt a 5C approach whereby participants are guided into translating what they learnt in the workshop in their classroom practice.<br><br>

<b>We organise various professional learning activities for you:</b> <br><br>

•   Courses and learning programmes<br>
•   Learning journeys<br>
•   Professional conversations with overseas and local educators<br>
•   Networked learning sessions e.g. ST-LT network<br>
•   Professional learning sessions for BTs
