<p>
The Physics Chapter strives to raise the professional standard in the subject discipline of physics, build a culture of professionalism and pride in the teaching fraternity and serve as a focal point for teacher collaboration and networking.<br><br>

<b>Comprising both the Secondary and Junior College levels, the goals of the Physics Chapter are two-fold:</b><br><br>

1.  To equip Secondary and Junior College Physics teachers with impactful and innovative pedagogies that are underpinned by sound learning theories, experimentation and research.<br>
2.  To inspire the wonder of Physics and inculcate the joy of learning Physics so that students who have the passion and ability in the subject will continue with Physics or a Physics-related STEM course in higher education institutes.<br><br>

<b>We organise various professional learning activities for you:</b><br><br>

•   Courses and Learning Programmes<br>
•   Learning Day/ Learning Journeys<br>
•   Professional Conversations with overseas and local educators<br>
•   Networked Learning Sessions e.g. ST-LT network<br>
•   Masterclasses / Demonstration Classes<br>
•   SkillsFuture for Educators’ Workshops
