AST recognises the important role Executive and Administrative Staff (EAS) play in the smooth running of operations in schools and HQ. The EAS Professional Development Unit (EASPDU) was set up in 2018 as a dedicated team to support the professional development needs of the diverse EAS group so that they can remain relevant and updated. The unit’s focus areas include:

*   Analyse and review the learning needs of EAS so that they can grow their professional abilities
*   Provision of programmes to develop EAS’ core and functional competencies
*   Building the culture of learning through active communication with the EAS community
