The Allied Educator Scheme was implemented with effect from 1 Jan 2009.&nbsp;&nbsp;Allied Educators (AEDs) are part of the school team who work closely with the teachers to ensure the holistic development of our students.&nbsp;&nbsp;The different groups of AEDs and job functions are as follows in&nbsp;Table 1&nbsp;below.

**Table 1: Groups and Job Functions of AEDs**

| AED | Job Function(s) |
|---|---|
| AED (LBS)  | Works closely with the school management in setting up structures and processes in the school to support students with special needs<br>Provides learning and behavioural support to students with mild special needs like autism, dyslexia, and attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br>  |
| AED (Teaching and Learning) | Works with teachers to enhance the teaching and learning of students in both academic and non-academic areas |
| School Counsellor (SC) | Works closely with the school management in planning and implementing a school-wide counselling system<br>Counsels pupils, consults school personnel and parents, and shares with teachers and parents counselling-related aspects<br>Conducts specialised guidance programmes with at-risk pupils who need additional help in their social and emotional development |

To support the development of AEDs at their various developmental roles, the AED Learning Frameworks articulate the learning needs of AEDs which progress along a continuum, as they perform unique and specialised skills-based roles in education, distinct from teachers.

##### Professional Learning for Allied Educators

The Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) provides for the training of the AEDs (T&amp;L).&nbsp;

AST also partners National Institute of Education (NIE) for the pre-service training of AEDs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pre-service training ensures that AEDs are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to fulfil their responsibilities in supporting teachers to enhance the teaching and learning of students in both academic and non-academic areas.&nbsp;

To enhance the professional development of AEDs, in-service courses are also arranged to provide them with broad-based skills.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides in-service courses, they are encouraged to look beyond face-to-face courses and workshops for their professional development.&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning could also take place through mentoring, school-based sharing and reflection, job-embedded learning, as well as networked learning.
