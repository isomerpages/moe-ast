#### Background
Mentoring was formally introduced to Singapore schools via the Structured Mentoring Programme (SMP) in 2006. To provide greater coherence of mentoring practices across schools, and to better prepare teacher-mentors for their mentoring role, the Skillful Teaching and Enhanced Mentoring (STEM) programme replaced the SMP in 2011, and the term ‘instructional mentoring’ was introduced, bringing the focus of mentoring to instructional matters.  

To extend the reach of instructional mentoring, the Enhanced Mentoring component of the STEM programme was rebranded as the Instructional Mentoring Programme (IMP) in 2015, and the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) replaced the Skillful Teacher Framework as the guide to promote high standards of teaching practice. 


#### Singapore Instructional Mentoring Approach
<img src="/images/sima-small.jpg">
				 
The Singapore Instructional Mentoring Approach (SIMA) articulates our vision and mission of instructional mentoring practice in schools, and outlines the essential elements of instructional mentoring. 

Guided by our mentoring mission to support and guide all mentees towards pedagogical excellence, SIMA emphasises three focus areas that are central to creating a quality instructional mentoring experience that will be valued and sought by all, namely, Promoting Mutual Growth, Relationship Building, and Localising Mentoring. The three associated processes detailed under each of these focus areas guide our Instructional Mentors in the knowledge, tools and protocols that are essential in supporting them to grow their mentoring practice, and create instructional mentoring experiences that are valued and sought by all, i.e., to all Beginning Teachers who are new to the profession and school, or experienced teachers seeking to grow and deepen their teaching practice.
