#### Overview of Teacher-led Workshops (TLW)

Teacher-Led Workshops (TLWs) are conducted **by teachers for teachers**. 

Guided by the mission of the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) to develop **a teacher-led culture of professional excellence**, TLW is a platform to **provide professional opportunities** for our teachers **to share their good practices** within the fraternity.

Through this platform, teachers will **engage in professional exchange of pedagogical content knowledge, leading to enhanced pedagogical practice**.

#### Call for Proposals for 2024 Teacher -Led Workshops (TLW) \[Final Deadline: 17 August 2023 (Thu)\]*

1. AST calls for proposals from teachers to conduct TLWs. The proposed TLW should be minimally shared previously at school-based or cluster-based platforms. Facilitators should also obtain approval from their principals before applying. 
2.	TLWs can be conducted individually or in teams of <u>up to three facilitators</u>. Correspondences will be made through the Main Facilitator via emails or calls. 
3.	Facilitators should propose a TLW that is relevant to the teaching level of students that they have applied their pedagogy or approach in their own classroom and school. For example, Junior College/Centralised Institute teachers should not be proposing a workshop meant for Primary school teachers. 
4. Online Video-conferencing (OVC) would be the preferred mode for TLWs. Subject to approval, facilitator(s) may also propose for their TLWs to be conducted as a face-to-face workshop, to be held at AST or at the facilitators' school (for location-based TLW). Another possible option would be e-TLW, an asynchronous e-learning package that would be hosted on OPAL2.0.
6. Please contact the AST TLW team, Ms Andrea Foo (FOO_Shi_Jia@moe.gov.sg) and Mr Benjamin Huang (Benjamin_HUANG@moe.gov.sg) should there be any queries.
