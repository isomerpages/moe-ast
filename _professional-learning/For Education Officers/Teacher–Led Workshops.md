#### Overview of Teacher-led Workshops (TLW)

Teacher-Led Workshops (TLWs) are conducted **by teachers for teachers**.

    From 2020, TLWs are conducted through three different modes of delivery: online via videoconferencing, e-learning (e-TLW) and face-to-face (skills based and subject to national posture).
