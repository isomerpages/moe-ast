#### Rationale of Teacher-Led Workshops

Teacher-Led Workshops (TLWs) are conducted by teachers for teachers. Guided by the mission of the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) to develop a teacher-led culture of professional excellence, AST has built on the work of Teachers’ Network to create opportunities for teachers to lead and inspire through the sharing of good practices. Through this platform, teachers will engage in professional exchange of pedagogical content knowledge, leading to enhanced pedagogical practice.

#### Objectives of Teacher-Led Workshops

*   Structure of Teacher-Led Workshops
    
    From 2020, TLWs are conducted through three different modes of delivery: online via videoconferencing, e-learning (e-TLW) and face-to-face (skills based and subject to national posture).  
      
    ![](https://staging.d2dfevnwgxersp.amplifyapp.com/images/tlw3.png)  
      
    Online via video conferencing and face-to-face workshops are held in the afternoons of Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays (usually in the months of February, March, April, July, and August).  
      
    The structure of **online via video conferencing**is as follows:

    The structure of **face-to-face** TLW (subject to national posture) is as follows:

    \* An online TLW and an e-TLW will not have a scheduled tea break, and should be planned to run for not more than two hours.  
      
    The structure of an **e-learning**TLW (mounted in OPAL2.0) is as follows:

*   Application for Teacher-Led Workshop
    
    **Application for 2023 Teacher-Led Workshop is [\[closed\]](https://go.gov.sg/tlw2023application)**  
      
    1\. AST calls for proposals from teachers to apply to conduct TLWs yearly. These proposed TLWs should minimally have been shared before at school-/cluster-based platforms and facilitators should obtain approval from their Principals before applying.  
      
    2\. TLWs are conducted individually or in teams of up to three facilitators. Correspondences will be made through the Main Facilitator via emails or calls.  
      
    3\. Facilitators should propose a TLW that is relevant to the teaching level of students that they have applied their pedagogy/approach in their own classroom and school. For example, Junior College/Centralised Institute teachers should not be proposing a workshop meant for Primary school teachers.  
      
    4. **OVC TLW will be the preferred mode for TLWs from 2023**. Subject to approval, facilitator(s) may propose for their TLWs to be conducted as  
    • F2F TLW, to be held at AST or at the facilitators’ school (for location-based TLW); or  
    • e-TLW, e-learning TLWs that are hosted on OPAL2.0.  
      
    5\. Facilitators may wish to refer to the **‘2023 Teacher-led Workshop (TLW) Application Information Sheet’** for more important information, such as the objectives, possible modes of TLW, proposed flow, eligibility criteria and timeline of application process.
