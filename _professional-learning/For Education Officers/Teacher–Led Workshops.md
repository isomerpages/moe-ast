<h4>Call for Proposals for 2025 Teacher -Led Workshops (TLW) [OPEN]</h4>
<p>The Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) is inviting educators to submit
proposals for Teacher-Led Workshops (TLWs). The proposed TLW should be
minimally shared previously at school-based or cluster-based platforms.
Additionally, facilitators are required to obtain approval from their principals
before submitting their proposals.</p>
<p>Facilitators are encouraged to propose TLWs that are relevant to the teaching
level of the students for whom they have applied their pedagogy or approach
in their own classrooms and schools. For instance, educators from Junior
Colleges or Centralised Institutes should tailor their workshops to the
needs of their peers at the same educational level, rather than proposing
workshops meant for Primary school teachers.</p>
