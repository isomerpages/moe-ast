The Teacher Leaders Programme (TLP) is a suite of three milestone programmes designed by the Academy of Singapore Teachers (AST) in collaboration with the National Institute of Education (NIE), to support the professional growth of our Senior Teachers (STs), Lead Teachers (LTs) and Master Teachers (MTTs). 

Guided by Teacher Leader Knowledge Bases that extends from the MOE’s Teacher Growth Model (TGM) and draws on the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP), the TLPs focuses on 
•	building a shared understanding regarding the core beliefs and the role of Teacher Leaders as pedagogical leaders and instructional mentors at the specific level of influence; 
•	building capabilities to lead and facilitate teams, and foster a collaborative professional learning culture with and/or beyond school, depending on level of appointment; and
•	broadening perspectives and providing support for leading in teaching and learning at the specific level of influence, through professional conversations on issues, trends, and developments in curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment.
