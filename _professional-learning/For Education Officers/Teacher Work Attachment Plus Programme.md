MOE values every Education Officer and is committed to supporting and developing their potential to the fullest.

The Teacher Work Attachment Plus (TWA+) programme encourages Education Officers to take up work attachments in other organisations to broaden perspectives, create new learning experiences for professional development and to enrich students’ learning.

MOE Education Officers who are keen to participate in the TWA+ programme can find out more details at [MOE Intranet](https://intranet.moe.gov.sg/academy/TWA/Pages/TWA.aspx)

We invite organisations who are interested to host a work attachment to send us a proposal or contact us at [TWA\_Plus@moe.gov.sg](mailto:TWA_Plus@moe.gov.sg).
