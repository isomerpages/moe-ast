<p>The OEIC programme (formerly known as Outstanding Educator-in-Residency*)
was first conceptualised in 2011 to provide opportunities for outstanding
educators from overseas to share their expertise and build networks with
the local educators.</p>
<p>The objectives of the OEIC Programme are to</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>leverage the expertise of outstanding overseas educators to further support
local educators in enhancing students’ learning experiences,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>enrich learning by providing opportunities for enactment of pedagogies;
and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>forge sustained partnerships between local and outstanding overseas educators
for impactful learning experiences.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>During their tenure in Singapore, the Outstanding Educator (OE) would
demonstrate skillful teaching in a Singapore classroom and facilitate professional
learning opportunities on the enacted pedagogy and other strategies for
effective teaching and learning. Additionally, the OE would partner with
schools, CPDD and NIE to share educational perspectives to inform decisions,
curriculum, pedagogical practices, and processes.</p>
<p><em>*OEIR programme was renamed the Outstanding Educator-in-Consultancy (OEIC) programme to emphasise continued partnership with the Outstanding Educator (OE)&nbsp;via consultancy, beyond their stint in Singapore.</em>

<h4><strong>Professional Learning and Networking Opportunities with our Outstanding Educators</strong></h4>
<p>In alignment with the Design Principles of Effective Professional Learning,
the OEIC Programme is crafted to offer our local educators valuable opportunities

<p>Master Teachers (MTT) and Teacher Collaborators (TC) play crucial roles
in designing and contextualising the Professional Learning. MTTs serve
as resource partners, leading the collaboration with the OE and the TC
on andragogical and curricular matters, while the Teacher Collaborator
(TC) supports the enactment of the pedagogies introduced in their classroom.</p>
