### Professional Development for Education Officers

The Academy provides a variety of professional development opportunities for teachers. The in-service training is customised to meet the needs of the teachers at every level. These include the Singapore Instructional Mentoring Programme, Teacher Leaders Programme, Teacher Work Attachment Programme and Outstanding Educator-in-Residence Programme. These professional development opportunities seek to build teachers' capacity in the subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge. In addition, conferences are organised for the sharing of the recent developments in pedagogy, curriculum and assessment.
