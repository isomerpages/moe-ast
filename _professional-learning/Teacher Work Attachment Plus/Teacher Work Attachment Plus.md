**About the Teacher Work Attachment Plus (TWA+) Programme**

Our education landscape and workplaces are changing rapidly. Once our students leave school, they will be faced with new growth areas in various industries arising from technological and societal changes. To help teachers be future-ready and better equipped to guide students in navigating the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) future, the Teacher Work Attachment Plus (TWA+) programme aims to broaden their perspectives through a range of learning journeys and work attachments in the public, private and people sectors. These professional learning experiences are specially curated to span different industry clusters and sectors, and designed to provide an insight into the trends, challenges, and opportunities of each industry.

**Work Attachment** offers participants an immersive experience with organisations for a duration of two to four weeks.

**Learning Journeys** allow participants to gain a broad overview of the organisations through a short visit.

**VISTAs** is an engagement series that aims for teachers to gain greater insights beyond their school by giving them exposure to thought leaders and industry experts.

**How Can Organisations Partner MOE to Support the TWA+ Programme?**

Organisations in the public, private and people sectors are our important partners who give teachers experiences outside the classroom and school. These work attachments and learning journeys will broaden teachers’ perspectives to the world of work, which they can share with their students, as well as infuse into teaching and learning through authentic, relevant content and innovative pedagogies. This will help to prepare young Singaporeans for a very different workplace organisation where the work environment will be fluid, borderless and constantly changing.

**What Does This Mean for Organisations?**

Teachers bring benefits to your organisation through TWA+ in the following ways:

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers are knowledgeable in content related to the subjects they teach, and could be engaged in discussions on education and youth-related issues.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers could provide input to/feedback on your programmes, products, services, projects, events, etc.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers can participate in projects and team discussions where they can promote team learning and contribute an alternative perspective at the same time.

·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers help raise awareness of your organisation’s branding, services and products.&nbsp; Upon completion of the attachment, teachers return to school and share their learning obtained from the work attachment with their fellow colleagues and students.
