<p><strong>About the Teacher Work Attachment Plus (TWA+) Programme</strong>
</p>
<p>Our education landscape and workplaces are changing rapidly. Once our
students leave school, they will be faced with new growth areas in various
industries arising from technological and societal changes. To help teachers
be future-ready and better equipped to guide students in navigating the
volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) future, the Teacher Work
Attachment Plus (TWA+) programme aims to broaden their perspectives through
a range of learning journeys and work attachments in the public, private
and people sectors. These professional learning experiences are specially
curated to span different industry clusters and sectors, and designed to
provide an insight into the trends, challenges, and opportunities of each
industry.</p>
<p><strong>Work Attachment</strong> offers participants an immersive experience
with organisations for a duration of two to four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Journeys</strong> allow participants to gain a broad overview
of the organisations through a short visit.</p>
<p><strong>VISTAs</strong> is an engagement series that gives teachers valuable
insights beyond their school by providing them with exposure to thought
leaders, industry experts and entrepreneurs. For 2025, VISTAs presents
exciting new content in a different format called Voices of Entrepreneurs!
Available in both vodcast and podcast formats, the series offers educators
on-demand online access.</p>

<p><strong>How Can Organisations Partner MOE to Support the TWA+ Programme?</strong>
</p>
<p>Organisations in the public, private and people sectors are our important
partners who give teachers experiences outside the classroom and school.
These work attachments and learning journeys will broaden teachers’ perspectives
to the world of work, which they can share with their students, as well
as infuse into teaching and learning through authentic, relevant content
and innovative pedagogies. This will help to prepare young Singaporeans
for a very different workplace organisation where the work environment
will be fluid, borderless and constantly changing.</p>
<p><strong>What Does This Mean for Organisations?</strong>
</p>
<p>Teachers bring benefits to your organisation through TWA+ in the following
ways:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers are knowledgeable in content
related to the subjects they teach, and could be engaged in discussions
on education and youth-related issues.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers could provide input to/feedback
on your programmes, products, services, projects, events, etc.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers can participate in projects
and team discussions where they can promote team learning and contribute
an alternative perspective at the same time.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teachers help raise awareness of
your organisation’s branding, services and products.&nbsp; Upon completion
of the attachment, teachers return to school and share their learning obtained
from the work attachment with their fellow colleagues and students.</p>
