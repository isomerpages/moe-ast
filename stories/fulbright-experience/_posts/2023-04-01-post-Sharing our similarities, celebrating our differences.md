In August 2017, as part of the Fulbright Distinguished Awards in Teaching Program, I first set foot in Bloomington, Indiana, knowing the city only by its reputation of being a university town. Over the course of the four months that I was there, I developed an affinity for the city and its people and affectionately called the place ‘home’. What struck me most about the Midwesterners was their extremely warm, kind, and down-to-earth nature. They were generally friendly with willing smiles and would even wave at strangers. Once, I was standing at the traffic junction wondering about my bearing and feeling a little lost. A passer-by automatically stopped to offer help. At the supermarket, the cashier would always greet customers with a smile and ask how the day was. When taking the public transport, be sure to shout out a “thank you!” to the driver, and be ready to receive a cheerful “Have a great day ahead!” response. In our hectic lives, we sometimes underestimate the power of these little gestures which would make someone’s day. For those treasured four months, I learnt to truly value and appreciate how these intricacies added “an extra layer of human touch” to our daily interactions with others.

Another characteristic of the Midwesterners is how they are community-minded. There is an incredibly strong community spirit where people enjoy spending time bonding with family and friends. Many of them identify strongly with specific communities which they belong to. Getting together for the 3Fs: Food, Fun and Festivities was commonplace. This is akin to Singapore’s ‘kampung spirit’, where there is a sense of social cohesion in a community, and where diversity is appreciated and respected. With the warm hospitality of my Bloomington hosts, there was no lack of community activities for me to participate in. Some of the more memorable activities include a picnic-cum-nature hike at McCormick’s Creek State Park, and a pumpkin-picking project where the pumpkins were picked and sold to raise money to build houses for under-privileged families in Mexico.

#### Application of Learning

> “To learn and not to do is really not to learn. To know and not to do is really not to know.”
~ Stephen R.Covey

The purpose of my inquiry project was to look at some of the best classroom practices in the United States, particularly those strategies and teaching actions that help students strengthen their reasoning and communication process skills.

Throughout the semester at Indiana University, I audited two courses. One of them examined modern cognitive theories of knowing, learning, and transferring; and the implications on teaching, motivating, assessing, and evaluating. The weekly readings and discussions gave me an in-depth view on the theoretical underpinnings of how learners learn and develop enduring understanding. This helped me better appreciate the evolution of the mathematics curricula over the years. The other course I audited opened more doors for me as the professor kindly invited me to participate in a professional development project for K-6 mathematics teachers in Owen and Monroe county. At the PD sessions, I was introduced to the book 5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematics Discussions, which identifies a set of teaching actions for teachers to achieve learning objectives by using student work as the launchpad for discussions. In the discussions, important mathematical ideas are surfaced for understanding to be developed or consolidated.

Besides the courses at Indiana University, I had the privilege of attending the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM) regional conference in Orlando. The conference was an excellent platform to network and to exchange ideas with fellow mathematics educators as I learnt the best practices for engaging students and for driving student achievement. Post-conference, the conversations still continue as I am now a proud member of the online NCTM community of like-minded researchers, teachers, parents, and individuals who are deeply passionate about mathematics and mathematics education.



#### Professional Development: NCTM Regional Conference in Orlando

As a culmination of my learning, I adapted some of the unit and lesson planning structures to guide teachers through planning lessons which focus on developing understanding. A sample unit package, complete with lesson resources, was put together to suggest ways in which the strategies outlined in Visible Thinking and from the “5 Practices for Orchestrating Productive Mathematics Discussions” could be interwoven into the lessons to complement the existing curriculum materials. Coupled with the use of mathematics discourse cards, the package is ready to be shared and tried out with our Singaporean students. Future plans include the refinement of the package based on feedback from teachers.

#### School, a place for dedicated teachers to inspire and to teach individuals, not the curriculum

One of the things that struck me most about the United States education system is the strong influence of the core American values of individualism and equality. Driven by the strong belief that each child is unique, significant emphasis and value are placed on individual initiative, independence and individual expression. This was clearly evident in the schools which I visited. One public school offers flexible ability grouping in mathematics for all 4th to 6th Grade students, allowing students to take the subject at a different grade levels based on their progress and learning needs. Another private school offers an inter-grade level differentiated grouping where teachers state the expectations and requirements of the classes, and students assess and reflect upon their own abilities before making their own choices on the class they would like to join. There are countless merits in tailoring teaching to the students’ needs. In order for this to work effectively, a few factors require careful consideration: teachers’ understanding of individual students’ needs, students’ self-awareness, and the knowledge of “what’s next” after grouping the students according to their needs.

A major highlight of my school experiences would be the visits to two Project Zero- based schools, both with long-standing histories implementing Visible Thinking as a school-wide framework for learning. It was impressive seeing the artefacts of the student’s work and hearing how articulate they were in expressing their opinions and defending their points of view with sound arguments, regardless of their age. The lesson observations provided me with some practical ideas of how visible thinking strategies could be interwoven into the mathematics classroom. This reaffirmed my perspective of education: that we should never underestimate the potential of our students and teachers when they are given the trust, faith and accountability to succeed. Nonetheless, I am also mindful that with all implementations, in order to bring change in the teaching practices, teachers’ buy-in and ownership is key.

#### The Fulbright experience, a once in lifetime opportunity

My Fulbright experience has impacted me in more ways than I could ever imagine, both personally and professionally. It was a unique blend of exciting learning experiences with quiet reflective time on an amazing journey of self-discovery.

On a personal level, developing friendships across perceived cultural boundaries is a skill which I picked up during the program. What better way to learn more about different cultures and countries than to live together as a Fulbright community “under one roof”? Bonding over tea, celebrating one another’s festivities, and appreciating cultural differences were just subtle ways in which we fulfilled the Fulbright program’s vision of promoting mutual understanding. Hearing the stories from other Fulbrighters helped me better appreciate what I have back home. Even as we return to our home countries, I am sure that we would still continue to keep in touch. In fact, plans to visit one another are already in the pipeline, and I look forward to travelling and meeting with my international friends.

Professionally, I have undergone the three different stages of unlearning, learning and re-learning. I had to keep an open mind to let go of preconceived ideas to broaden my learning. In the process of unlearning, I frequently found myself examining my current teaching practices, and questioning what I hoped to accomplish with my project to improve teaching practices back home. With insightful readings and rich conversations with my advisor, faculty members, and other teachers, I embarked on the learning stage, which led to further questioning and reflections. At times, toggling between learning and unlearning, and re-examining practices led me to feel frustrated. Nonetheless, the re-learning process will continue even as the Fulbright program has concluded, and as I share what I have learnt with fellow Singapore teachers.

In summary, the essence of my Fulbright experience lies in having the great privilege to take a step back from the hustle and bustle of everyday school life to reflect and to ask questions about what we do not know.
