My Fulbright Experience started when award recipients were asked to participate in an online course with two course administrators. The course provided a comprehensive introduction to cultural exchanges, the American lifestyle, and life in Indiana University. The opportunity to work, and interact, with 18 international teachers from 8 different countries (Finland, India, Israel, Morocco, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and Taiwan) was one of the key highlights as it was reminiscent of being back in varsity. It was a memorable experience as we cooked our own home cuisines, shared our culturally unique recipes, and savoured delicacies. I especially enjoyed the times when we would share our life stories, and was moved by the personal accounts of life back in their home countries.  
  
I gained a rich learning experience from the school visits, auditing courses at Indiana University, and having professional conversations with teachers, lecturers and students. To me, the cross-cultural experience, which is the intent of this Fulbright experience, was indeed the icing on the cake. This invaluable experience is the best gift bestowed to me, as an individual, and as a teacher.

I enjoyed the many interactions with fellow educators whom I met through presentations, and other academic and social meet-ups. Through the conversations, I was exposed to the American culture, be it through food, hobbies or sports. For recreation, I participated in activities with the locals such as golfing and drumming. I must express my appreciation to Jacob Butler (course administrator) for being most helpful; to past and present Fulbrighters like Alex (2016), Kate (2017), Martha (2016), David (2015), and Nathan (2017) for their warm welcome and generosity; and to the teachers who have since become close friends: Susan and Steven.  
  
The various cultural exchanges gave me new insights. I was able to learn more about what it means to be a teacher in different international and cultural contexts, often over cosy home-cooked meals which we took turns to prepare. The 17 other Fulbrighters and I shared our aims and inspirations, and the challenges we faced in our professional practice. I found it fulfilling and rewarding to be exposed to educational issues all over the world in these rich, meaningful interactions.  
  
#### Professional Development  
  
I conducted a fieldwork session through an environmental sciences lesson fieldwork organised by Bloomington High School, and was able to interact with students. It was a challenge to officially take students out and to talk to them about geography education as there are stark differences between our curricula. What I really enjoyed that day was teaching them how to observe the environment and doing field sketches with them. The sketches produced were of high quality, and I was very pleased with their performance.

Aside from the official platforms in school to develop professionally, I found that collaboration with and the sharing of best practices by staff and other Fulbrighters at various presentation platforms have also moulded me professionally. I was also moved by the Fulbright Alumni who got in touch with me and invited me to visit their schools. Through working with students and engaging them in conversations about life, and about the learning and teaching of geography, I gained a deeper insight into teaching and learning in the US.  
  
A total of 12 school visits (5 in Indiana, 3 in Chicago, 1 in San Francisco, 3 in Seattle) were successfully completed from August to November 2017. I visited a specific school eight times in Indiana which gave me opportunities to conduct an in-depth study, and to engage in deep discussions on educational and policy issues. I noticed that for all teachers, students are central and their main concern is for the child. The love and concern for them is a constant reminder of my job as a teacher and as an individual. The saddest point during the four-month attachment was when the inner-city students spoke to me about what safety meant to them. To them, school is a safe haven. When I highlighted that Singaporeans can be out in the streets at any time of the day, they were stunned. I was overwhelmed when they told me how “unsafe” certain places were, even their own homes. After the conversations, the teachers and students approached me and gave me a hug. I felt moved, and was grateful for being in Singapore where we live peacefully together without having to constantly worry about physical safety.  
  
It was indeed enriching working with the American teachers teaching social studies and discussing with them the importance of fieldwork in enhancing students’ learning. I also learnt how literacy was taught and woven into the classrooms as teachers gave explicit examples on suggested strategies. Framing my inquiry within the field of disciplinary literacy was helpful in achieving this aim. The particular skills required from students as they embarked on geography fieldwork are not dissimilar to the cognitive approaches required in science. As such, supporting students to progress within the specific literacy demands of the subject offers both a challenging and an interesting perspective. My main takeaway was that I should provide more scaffolding when working with less academically-inclined students. Previously I would assume that my students would be able to complete the assigned task with my teaching resources and instructional strategies. I only realised the difficulties they face in understanding the questions and in crafting the answers when I am in class and have conversations with them. Moreover, in the schools I observed, teachers mostly focused on content without the explicit teaching of literacy. The worksheets used were provided a good amount of scaffolding on processes, as compared to the content-heavy worksheets used in most Singapore schools.  
  
Students who needed additional help in grasping English may be reassigned to another class, one that is supported by a native speaker. For instance, mathematics is taught in English by a mathematics teacher with an accompanying Spanish teacher who translates the lesson. Printed notes and PowerPoint slides tend not to be given in copious amounts, so students make their own notes or write their own reflections. They also record salient points using templates prepared by the teachers to aid them in their thinking and learning.  
  
Attending social studies conferences both in Indiana and San Francisco (National Council of Social Studies 2017) provided me with an excellent opportunity to share my work on citizenship and values in Singapore with the teachers, and to learn best practices from them. I found the sharing sessions particularly motivating and useful as I learnt about the cognitive process behind the creation of the lesson plans, and also gained insights on Assessment, Pedagogy and Curriculum as experienced by practitioners.

Through the conference and professional conversations with the teachers and students, and the classes I audited at Indiana University, I redefined my inquiry project on how fieldwork could be taught to my Normal (Academic) students. I realised how my teaching in the class could be improved and how to provide more scaffolding to encourage my students to think and to write in the fieldwork domain. I am excited to share my learning and these approaches through hands-on sharing and workshop sessions with my fellow colleagues back in Singapore.  
  
#### Personal Growth  
  
What then, is this Fulbright experience? It is definitely not the inquiry project alone, but the many meaningful interactions with fellow teaching practitioners from around the world. This experience is beyond written words. I am thankful and grateful for this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
