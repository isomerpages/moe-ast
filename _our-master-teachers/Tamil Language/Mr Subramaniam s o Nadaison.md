#### Profile

Mr Subramaniam Nadaison has been a Tamil Language (TL) Master Teacher since 2012 in the Curriculum Planning and Development Division (CPDD) and subsequently, in the Academy of Singapore Teachers. Formerly a Curriculum Planning Officer at CPDD, Subramaniam played a key role in supporting schools in the planning and implementation of holistic assessment, and also contributed to two major TL reviews at the national level in 2006 and in 2010. In 2003, he was awarded the Outstanding Resource Teacher Award. In 2006, he received the MOE Postgraduate Scholarship. His book _Creative Writing, Positive Affect and Formative Assessment_ was published in 2010. Subramaniam led several pedagogical-based book publication projects focusing on extensive reading, creative teaching, spoken interaction skills, Tamil cultural literacy and learning through play. Currently, he is working on a book project which aims to unpack how Tamil ethical poems are taught to students effectively from primary to college level. Subramaniam believes firmly that a great teacher leads the way to an uncharted journey of discovery learning. He actively involves his fellow TL teachers in several community-based projects so as to promote the use of TL particularly amongst the Tamil youths and the community at large.
