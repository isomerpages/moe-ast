#### Profile

Miss Joanna Phan Swee Lee joined PESTA in August 2014 after a stint at the Singapore International School (Hong Kong) where she headed the Physical Education, Co-Curricular Activities and Student Leadership departments from 2010 to 2014. Prior to this, she was a Head of Department for PE and Co-Curricular Activities at Catholic High School (Primary) from 2006 to 2010.

At PESTA, Joanna is a Senior Academy Officer who designs professional development courses and conducts them. Her areas of specialization currently are in the teaching of Dance, conducting Inclusive PE in Mainstream Schools and the teaching of softball. Joanna also works closely with HODs, TLs and teachers at the primary and secondary schools to provide more targeted professional support. This includes collaborating with the PE teachers (HODs, TLs and teachers) to co-design lessons and supporting teachers in the delivery of these lessons. During these collaborations, the teachers are guided and ‘taught to fish’ so that they become more confident of their abilities and skills to deliver quality PE lessons.

Joanna has a deep interest in adult learning and has completed her part-time masters in Professional Education at the National Institute of Education. The knowledge and skills acquired from the course has helped her design more effective professional development courses. She is currently exploring the use of blended learning to make professional development courses more accessible to teachers. Joanna is also an avid softball player who represented Singapore from 1992 to 2004. She now plays the sport mostly at club level and still represents Singapore at the Asian Masters tournaments.
