#### Profile

Ms Karen Low Lai Fong started her career as a young beginning teacher at White Sand Primary School in 2003. Being an inexperienced classroom and PE teacher who was still learning the rope of effective classroom management, she encountered days that were good and bad (teary once in a while). Equipped with essential ingredients during the survival years - positive mindset, humility to ask and learn actively, as well as a group of helpful colleagues, she grew professionally and became the Head of Department (PE, Aesthetics & CCA) from 2006 to 2012. Being a former national sprinter and a club player in Ultimate Frisbee and Tennis, she has initiated and organised Zonal Ultimate Frisbee competitions, and coached school T&F athletes as well as combined school tennis team players during her stint in school.

Karen joined the Physical Education and Sports Teacher Academy (PESTA) as a Programme Manager in 2012 after being awarded the MOE Postgraduate Scholarship. In 2013, she pursued her Master of Science (Exercise and Sport Studies) full time at National Institute of Education, National Technological University. She returned to PESTA upon completion of her studies in 2014. Since then, Karen has been working closely with PE teachers of different profiles and levels on the ground to learn from and with one another on effective teaching and learning.

Karen is particularly interested in the movement approach to Dance and Gymnastics for preschool and primary level after witnessing the development of creativity and positive self-esteem amongst students. She is also keen to learn the motor skills of for all students, including those with special learning needs. It stems from her belief that all children can learn and want to learn. At present, Karen continues to experiment with the Universal Design for Learning principles for different age groups to provide high autonomy within task for students of different abilities with the aim to achieve the learning outcomes and the joy of learning.
