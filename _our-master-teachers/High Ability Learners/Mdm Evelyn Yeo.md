#### Profile

Evelyn graduated with a Bachelor of Arts (Education) (Hons) and attained her Masters in Applied Linguistics from the Nanyang Technological University/ National Institute of Education, Singapore.

Prior to joining AST, Evelyn served as Head of Department/ English Language with Innova Primary School before assuming the role of Lead Teacher/ High Ability Learners (HAL) in 2017. Evelyn recognises that high ability learners can be found in every school; and their learning needs have to be met so that they could be appropriately challenged and supported to experience joy in learning. As Lead Teacher/HAL, she led the design and customisation of Innova Primary School’s English Language, Mathematics and Science programmes to meet the learning needs of HALs.

Evelyn holds the belief that when teachers _learn from, with and on behalf of others_, they grow in their knowledge and skills to improve teaching practice and student outcomes. Guided by this belief and conviction, she spearheaded the setting up of the HAL Networked Learning Community (NLC) to promote a culture of networked learning among Teacher Leaders and teachers of HALs in Primary Schools, to collaboratively support the learning and socio-emotional needs of HALs.

Evelyn’s areas of interest in classroom inquiry include differentiating instruction for HALs in mixed-ability classrooms and promoting critical thinking of HALs.

In recognition of her contribution to the professional development of fellow teachers in the fraternity, she was conferred the Associate of Academy of Singapore Teachers in 2018, 2019 and 2020.
