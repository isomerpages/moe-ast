#### Profile

Nazir graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering (Hons) from the University of Surrey in the UK, and obtained his PhD in Education from the National Institute of Education (NIE), Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in Singapore. He believes in instilling a love for learning by creating positive learning experiences and unlocking the creative potential of both students and teachers.  
  
Prior to joining AST, Nazir was a Lead Teacher in Greenview Secondary School, where he taught for over 13 years. He was also leading the East 1 Senior/Lead Teacher Cluster Collaboration Group for over three years. He is very passionate about developing feasible teaching approaches that appeal to students, and has mentored teachers to carry out collaborative classroom projects and presenting them at the cluster, zonal, national and international levels. In addition, he has also published numerous research articles in international peer-reviewed journals and book chapters. Nazir is honoured to have been invited to present his work both locally and at international platforms.  
  
Nazir’s interest lies in working with communities of teachers to co-develop feasible instructional strategies to motivate and engage students, who are especially lower in progress. He developed the ‘Relevant, Appealing and Personal’ (RAP) pedagogical guideline in getting students to be cognitively and emotionally connected to the learning content across subjects. In mentoring teachers, Nazir highlights how ‘RAP’ principles can be infused into various pedagogical approaches to get students intrinsically motivated and on-task in their lessons. This contributes to students developing positive attitudes towards their studies, which in turn builds their confidence that can lead to positive academic achievement.  
  
Nazir has been awarded ‘Fellow of AST’ in 2012, the ‘President’s Award for Teachers’ in 2014, and the ‘Fulbright Distinguished Awards for Teaching’ in 2016. He also led a Professional Learning Community of teachers in his school to co-develop and implement a RAP-infused multi-disciplinary curriculum that led them to clinch the Innergy (Gold) Awards in 2015.
