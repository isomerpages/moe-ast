#### Profile

Mr Joseph Tham was a History graduate from the National University of Singapore. He has been in the classroom for more than 17 years. He was at Crescent Girls’ School for 10 years before he was appointed Master Teacher in 2017. Mr Tham strongly believes in the importance of History as a subject: he feels that every student will be a better citizen of Singapore and the world if he/she is aware and understands History. He is very passionate about exploring different pedagogies to make History lessons more meaningful but fun for the students. He is also very keen to explore the inter-connectedness between History and other disciplines. He attained a Master’s Degree in Asian Art History from LaSalle College/Goldsmith College in 2014 and has contributed to both local and overseas publications on cultural history.
