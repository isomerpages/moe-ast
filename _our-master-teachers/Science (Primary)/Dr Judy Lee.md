#### Profile

Judy began her teaching journey as a physics teacher in a junior college.  Her interest in the design of learning experiences led her to join the Educational Technology Division, and to obtain her Master of Science (Education) in the area of Instructional Systems Technology at Indiana University (Bloomington).  She also served as a Vice-Principal for three years in a primary school, before being seconded as a Teaching Fellow to the National Institute of Education (NIE), where she was involved in teaching and mentoring trainee teachers, and educational research.  The meaningful nature of journeying with teachers in their professional growth bolstered her interest in the nature of teacher learning.  She completed a Doctor of Philosophy (Education) on teacher learning, and shared her work at various international conferences. She enjoys working with primary science teachers to inquire on teaching practices and students’ learning.
