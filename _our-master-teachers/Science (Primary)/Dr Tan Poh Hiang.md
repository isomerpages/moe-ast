#### Profile

Poh Hiang started her teaching career in a secondary school, teaching Physics, Mathematics and Computer Applications to students from different streams and levels. As HOD/IT, Poh Hiang was responsible for the implementation of first IT MasterPlan in the school; and she was also involved in the pilot programs for new platforms like Integrated Examination Systems (IES) as well as TRAISI. In 2001, Poh Hiang was posted to Assessment and Research Division, which eventually became a statutory board and was renamed Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB). During her nine years in SEAB, Poh Hiang had a wide range of experiences from PSLE (Science) to A-level Physics Practical. Before she left SEAB for National Institute of Education (NIE) in 2010, Poh Hiang was the chief coordinator of O-level School-based Practical Assessment (SPA) at national level. As a teaching fellow in NIE, Poh Hiang taught pre-service and in-service courses from primary science to secondary school Physics. After her four year stint in NIE, she had the opportunity to teach science in a primary school for a year, during which she conducted several courses on item analysis for the teachers in her school as well as science teachers in her cluster schools. Poh Hiang has strong interest in assessment and is currently into her fifth year of part-time PhD which focuses on formative assessment in the primary science classrooms. Her research is funded by the Singapore Millennium Foundation and she has presented and published her findings in several international conferences and a book chapter. For her research, Poh Hiang was also awarded the 2014 NIE Dean’s commendation for research.
