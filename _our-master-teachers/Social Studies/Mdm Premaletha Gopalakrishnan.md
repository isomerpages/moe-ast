#### Profile

Premaletha has taught for over 28 years. She has taught History and Social Studies since its implementation. She was a Lead Teacher (History) before being appointed as Master Teacher in Social Studies. She believes in lifelong learning and completed her Master in Education in Curriculum and Teaching in 2013. Her experience during the Fulbright Distinguished Award for Teachers in 2015 @ Indiana University, provided the opportunity to explore issues on Citizenship Education. She has collaborated with CPDD Social Studies and History Unit on various syllabus reviews and syllabus implementation matters. She has contributed in various resource development committees and national curriculum design and tried various pedagogical approaches to bring the Humanities alive.  
  
Premaletha started her teaching journey as an Economics teacher and then moved on to teach History and Social Studies. As a teacher embarking on this journey of wanting to make the difference in the life of students, she has been dedicated in engaging her students to see the relevance and connections in what they are learning. She has taken on several portfolios like Subject Head, then HOD Humanities, Senior Teacher and now a Master Teacher. These experiences gave her the opportunity to hone her craft to become a confident teacher-leader and a mentor to many young teachers. With her appointment as Master Teacher (SS) in 2017, she hopes to support in professional development and growth of teachers in the fraternity.
