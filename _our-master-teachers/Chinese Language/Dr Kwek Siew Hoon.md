#### Profile

Siew Hoon began her teaching career in Dunman Secondary school after she graduated from the National University of Singapore in 1988 and the National Institute of Education (NIE) in 1989. In the interest of developing her academic knowledge of education, she then proceeded to complete her Master of Educational Studies in 1998 at The University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. This paved the foundation for her to pursue her Doctor in Education (EDD) in the NIE from 2012 to 2019.

Having taught at a diversity of schools such as ACS (Independent), St Gabriel’s Secondary, Raffles Institution and Singapore Chinese Girls School, Siew Hoon had gained great insight into teaching students of varying profiles throughout her 15 years of teaching experience. Teaching students of diverse abilities in a variety of school settings had been a humbling experience which drove her to continue to develop her passion for helping students learn the Chinese Language (CL) with joy and enthusiasm.

In her career development, she had the opportunity to hold leadership positions such as Subject Head, Curriculum Head, and Head of Department. Siew Hoon’s stint at Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) also contributed to her developing interest in assessment, which then became her current research and teaching interest.

In 2011, Siew Hoon took up the position of a Teaching Fellow in SCCL, to develop her growing interest in teacher-training. In 2013 she was appointed a CL Master Teacher, which saw her continuing to train and mentor CL teachers at both primary and secondary schools. In 2019, she took up the role of Principal Master Teacher (PMTT).

As a PMTT, Siew Hoon wishes to influence and impact a wider community through different professional development platforms to help fellow CL teachers strengthen their pedagogical and subject content knowledge. Siew Hoon believes that in our current CL teaching settings, it is essential that teachers address students’ learning needs, learning interest, and readiness to learn first before selecting appropriate pedagogical practices. This, she believes, is to ensure that the students can learn their mother tongue with both joy and rigor.
