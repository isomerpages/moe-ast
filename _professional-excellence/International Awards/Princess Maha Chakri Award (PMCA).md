<p><strong>Mdm Chong Chew Luan Penny <br>Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary School </strong>
<br>
</p>
<p>Mdm Chong Chew Luan Penny is a teacher for visually impaired (VI) students,
and she strongly believes in inclusive education. She has dedicated 15
years of excellent service to nurturing VI students in Ahmad Ibrahim Secondary
School (AISS), which has 7 students who are VI and need additional support.
Mdm Chong has been a dedicated resource teacher for all subjects that her
VI students undertake. This duty also includes converting academic materials
into Braille, developing additional materials, or embarking on ad hoc projects
like learning an online tool for music composition to assist a student
how to use it for his music examination at O-level. She also leads the
other VI resource teachers in providing the best coaching programme for
the VI students in the school.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Mdm Chong played an instrumental role in the holistic development of VI
students through the implementation of various initiatives. For instance,
she initiated a collaboration between the school and National University
of Singapore’s College of Alice and Peter Tan since 2018 to reinforce the
school's 2-level approach to the VI programme, whereby VI students learn
daily living skills to gain greater independence and our sighted students
learn to help and care for the VI. Building on this collaboration, Mdm
Chong continued to develop the character and confidence of her VI students
through service-learning experiences with the elderly in St. Luke’s Care
Centre, and through teaching Braille to younger children from Tasek Jurong,
a non-profit organisation that runs programmes to support and uplift the
community.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>While working on her students’ academic progress, Mdm Chong is also conscious
about promoting inclusion in and outside of school. Therefore, she creates
opportunities for VI students to interact with sighted students and get
them involved in activities externally, where they work with mentors to
pursue their interests or showcase their talents. For instance, since 2014,
Penny has liaised with Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) and coordinated with the
Assistant Year-Head and Form Teachers to organise the annual Dialogue-in-the-Dark
Learning Journey in NP. This aims to provide first-hand experience of the
challenges which VI persons face in their daily lives. Another partnership
was with the Singapore Art Museum, where artists like Ling Nah and Angie
Seah incorporated adaptations in their artworks for the VI students, allowing
them to have hands-on activities that develop their analytical skills in
art.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Mdm Chong is regarded as an expert on educational matters for VI students
due to her rich experience and the depth of her work. As a result, Mdm
Chong often shares her knowledge with officers in MOE HQ, other education
institutions and Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board on VI-related
issues. Beyond Singapore, Mdm Chong had also hosted a Vietnamese delegate
from Nguyen Ding Chiu School for the Blind in Ho Chih Minh City, where
she shared and exchanged pedagogy and practices with the delegate. This
exchange also broadened her views on VI education which enriches her work
with her VI students. These professional conversations have helped the
fraternity grow its knowledge in teaching VI students. Furthermore, her
work with the VI students at AISS has broadly shaped the school’s way of
managing and working with SEN students, and in supporting access arrangement
for students with various impairments for learning and examinations.</p>
