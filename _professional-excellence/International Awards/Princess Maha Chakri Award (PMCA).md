</p>
<p>Mdm Ang Sing Yee champions inclusive education anchored in strong teacher-student
relationships. She focuses on supporting students with special educational
needs and those from challenging backgrounds, fostering a supportive learning
environment for all students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As the team lead for special educational needs in her school, Mdm Ang
is a role model for the staff in building a warm and supportive culture.
She collaborates closely with the school's special educational needs officer
to understand and effectively address these students' challenges and help
them to develop holistically. This teamwork has resulted in significant
improvements in both students' behaviour and development, and academic
confidence as they progress through school. For example, one student, who
was disruptive and unfocused in Secondary 1, graduated as a top student
of the cohort and progressed to a polytechnic. Mdm Ang also creates tailored
intervention plans for her students with additional needs, teaching them
life skills and transforming their lives. With her intensive support plan,
another student from a challenging family background learnt to manage the
demands of home and school, and successfully applied to polytechnic, thus
gaining renewed optimism for the future.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mdm Ang leveraged her experience in fostering strong teacher-student relationships
to pioneer the use of the Teacher-Student Relationship Inventory, developed
by the Singapore Ministry of Education. &nbsp;Her effort successfully helped
teachers in her school foster strong relationships with their students
as they adjusted their practices to better support students’ needs. She
was invited by the Ministry to share her approach implementing the inventory
at the 2023 Teachers' Conference and ExCEL Fest, inspiring educators nationwide.&nbsp;
She also partnered the Ministry to develop a video showcasing the impact
of the inventory, that was widely shared with all teachers.&nbsp; She has
also implemented various school-wide initiatives to build teacher-student
relationships and to enhance student well-being, for example, “Tender Tuesdays”,
to provide weekly opportunities for one-on-one teacher-student chats, a
“Back-to-School” package, to ease students' transition to school after
long holidays, and “Mindful Monday” to build emotional regulation and resilience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Recognising the importance of holistic development, Mdm Ang refreshed
the school's signature STAR Programme to heighten students’ awareness of
community needs. This programme provides students with authentic experiences
to develop their character and 21st-century competencies, with themes expanding
from “Self” in Secondary 1 to “World” in Secondary 4. To provide community-related
experiences, her team planned visits to various community groups, allowing
students to gain better awareness of diverse communities in Singapore.
For example, some Secondary 3 students went on a learning journey to Enabling
Village, where they had the opportunity to interact with people of varied
abilities and hear their inspiring stories, helping them better relate
to schoolmates with different abilities and special educational needs.
She also initiated “Felicitous Friday” to celebrate student successes and
share inspirational stories, contributing to a positive school culture.
&nbsp;In 2023, she invited students to share their inspiring community
service experiences of “Volunteering at International Migrants Day”.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond her school, Mdm Ang actively engages with parents and the community.
&nbsp;She strengthened parent-school partnerships by establishing four
annual touchpoints between parents and teachers. &nbsp;Her efforts extend
to collaborating with external agencies like TOUCH Youth and REACH to support
students with more complex needs.</p>
