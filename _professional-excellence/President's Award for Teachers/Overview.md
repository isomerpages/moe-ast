<h3>President’s Award for Teachers (PAT)</h3>
<p>The President’s Award for Teachers (PAT) recognises excellent educators
for their role in moulding the future of our nation.</p>
<p>In recognition of their inspiration to their students and peers, eight
outstanding educators received the PAT 2024 from President Tharman Shanmugaratnam
during the Teachers’ Day Reception held at the Fairmont Hotel on Thursday,
29 August 2024. They constantly adopt innovative approaches in their lessons,
and are lifelong learners and mentors to their peers. They reach out to
their students, affirm their strengths and efforts, and encourage them
to pursue their dreams. Through their words and deeds, these educators
are an inspiration to their students and colleagues.</p>
