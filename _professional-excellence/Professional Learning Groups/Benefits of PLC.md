### Benefits of PLC 

Group reflection in a Professional Learning Community (PLC) is an empowering process. Through PLC, staff gain a greater sense of support and feedback from their peers. This can have a positive impact on their learning and practice (Roberts, S. & Pruitt, E. Z., 2009).

As the goal of PLCs is to ultimately improve student outcomes, conversations among staff would be more focused on this. Staff would be more willing to voice their differing opinions and step out of their comfort zones; they learn from one another and experiment with new instructional strategies as they have strong peer support.
