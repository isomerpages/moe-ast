The Singapore Teaching Practice (STP) is a model that makes explicit how effective teaching and learning is achieved in Singapore schools. Anchored on the notion that teaching is a profession,&nbsp;the STP draws on Singapore educatorsâ€™ beliefs about how students learn and teachers teach. It is represented in the form of an orchid to reflect the Singapore context within which we practise our craft and seek to improve our practice as a collaborative fraternity.
